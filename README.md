Project Title: Aviation Accident Analysis: Identifying Low-Risk Aircraft
Overview
This project aims to analyze aviation accidents to determine which aircraft pose the lowest risk for commercial and private operations. By examining various factors such as aircraft type, age, and usage, we seek to quantify and compare the risk levels associated with different aircraft models. The insights gained from this analysis can inform safety measures and operational decisions in the aviation industry.


Objective
Determine which aircraft pose the lowest risk for commercial and private operations.

Key Questions
What factors contribute to the risk of accidents (e.g., aircraft type, age, usage)?
How can we quantify and compare the risk levels of different aircraft?
Data Sources
Aviation Accident Database & Synopses: This dataset includes records of accidents, incident reports, aircraft types, operational history, and more.
Data Collection
We gathered data on aircraft accidents, including:

Aircraft make and model
Year of manufacture
Number of accidents per aircraft type
Severity of accidents (fatalities, injuries)
Operational history (commercial vs. private use)
Other relevant factors (e.g., maintenance records, pilot experience)
Data Preparation
The data preparation process involved:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
Feature Engineering: Creating new variables such as accident rates per aircraft type and the age of the aircraft at the time of the accident.
Data Exploration
Initial exploration of the dataset included:


Identification of key variables that impact accident rates.
Data Visualization
Visualizations were created to illustrate key findings, including:

Trends in the number of accidents over the years.
The top aircraft makes by accident count.
Results and Insights
The analysis revealed significant insights regarding aircraft safety, including:

Trends in accident frequency over time.
Identification of aircraft models with consistently low accident rates.
